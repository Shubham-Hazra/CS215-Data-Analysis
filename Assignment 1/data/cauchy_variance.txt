var1 = variance(x,y,-10,20,10000); //Variance calculated between -10 and 20
var2 = variance(x,y,-100,200,10000); // Between -100 and 200
var3 = variance(x,y,-500,1000,10000); // -500 and 1000
var4 = variance(x,y,-1000,2000,10000); // -1000 and 2000

Output:
9.4493

94.4492

471.2728

940.1129

Clearly the variance diverges as we take larger intervals and hence variance
is undefined.
